## Decoding the Data


enc    energy of cosmic ray event in EeV (E="Exa"=10^18)

(The following angles are in degrees)
phi     using a "Earth local coordinate system where x is east, y is north and z is straight up, this is the angle counter-clockwise from east (in math classes you call this theta, in physics it is phi).

zen    zenith angle -- or "Polar angle" ... what math textbooks call "phi" but physics texts call "theta"

azi     astronomers' azimuthal angle measured clockwise from north this is also the convention for navigational "bearing"

sid    sidereal time in "hours" -- multiply by 15 to get degrees "equatorial" celestial coordinates

RA    Right Ascension in degrees

DEC  declination in degrees

Not included in the table
Astronomers use Altitude (Alt) + Azimuth for pointing telescopes
Alt = 90-zen (in degrees)

By the way the coordinates of our detector was at (needed to convert Alt+Azi to RA+DEC and vise versa)
