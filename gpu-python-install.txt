This works on Ubuntu AND WSL2

(1) clone the GIT repository in your folder
$ git clone https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/gpu-python-tutorial.git

(2) Create a Conda environment "cuda01" (you can name it whatever)
that has no libraries of any kind... "PRISTINE"
$ conda create -n cuda01

(3) activate the "cuda01" environment ... drops your shell into it for PYTHON
$ condat activate cuda01

(4) You are now in the cuda01 environment, set up the CUDA stuff
This step will take a bit of time (~1-2 hours) and will require you to say yes 
before actually installing

(cuda01) $ conda install -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c numba -c conda-forge \
    cudf=21.06 python=3.7 cudatoolkit=11.2

...wait (~1hr) for the prompt to go ahead and install
... wait (~30 min.) for installation

(5) Now install some other packages you will need ... in most of these cases it will prompt
you to OK the start of installation... these don't take very long

(cuda01) $ conda install numba
(cuda01) $ conda install numpy
(cuda01) $ conda install matplotlib
(cuda01) $ conda install notebook
(cuda01) $ conda deactivate
$ exit

(6) Start a new shell/terminal/Ubuntu WSL2 session

$ condat activate cuda01

(7) Start Jupyter Notebook

(cuda01) $ jupyter notebook


(8) Start beowser and go to localhost:8888, and navigate to gpu-python-tutorial
You can start going through the first few notebooks

...

Don't forget to deactivate the environment before exiting
(cuda01) $ conda deactivate
$ exit
